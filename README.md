## Introduction

In this project the most common examples of testing with the Karate framework are applied.
To apply the test cases we will use the test website https://reqres.in/, which provides several endpoints on which you can make GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests.

## Testing API with Karate

Karate is the only open source tool that combines API test automation, mocks, performance testing and even UI automation into a single unified framework. 
The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy even for non-programmers. Powerful JSON assertions are built in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.
